<h1>Instructor's Note</h1>

        <h2>Debashish Shom</h2>
        <h3>Reading Photographs and Building Narrative</h3>
        
        <p>In street, you can find a photograph, a printed one, dirty and faded or you can look at a photograph on your high contrast computer screen. 
        Otherwise, you can look at a photograph of an exotic landscape or an iconic photograph from the history. They can be read or viewed from 
        different perspective or levels and your mind responses very differently. Being a photographer, it is very important and fascinating to 
        read photographs from different levels.</p>
        
        <p>It is also very exciting to look at how photographs from different levels or may be from the same level work together to build a narrative. 
        It is more like musical notes; from different scales they synchronize and blow our mind.</p>




        <h2>Syed Latif Hossain</h2>
        <h3>Digital Post Processing</h3>

        <p>Grabbing some images is of course a part of photography. Not to mention, the most important part. It can just be fine-'n-easy if you are pursuing
         it as a hobby. The trouble begins if you want to go beyond that.</p>
        <p>The list of to-dos is quite long in terms of things to address before-and-after the shoot; in terms of knowledge, perception, skill, time, place 
        and all this. In todayâ€™s scenario, managing digital assets (mostly images, in case of a photographer) and post-processing the images remain a major 
        hurdle for many if not most of the aspiring photographers. Choice of digital solutions to tackle these hurdles are quite mind-boggling. Learn how to 
        manage (from shooting to organizing in a meaningful way and keeping your images ready for chucking them out in a whiz in times of need) if you want 
        to keep your edges sharp in a demanding professional scenario.</p>
