<p>On February 23rd, 2015 BUET Photographic Society announced its newest endeavour, a 3 day long street photography workshop 
which was supposed to be followed by an on campus exhibition. </p>

<p>The workshop is designed to match both the beginners and amateurs who are practicing photography for a while. Street is perhaps 
the most common place where we start to shoot early and Street offers an unbound space to explore . From candid to witty humors, from 
layers of magic to decisive moments it has so much to offer as a single genre that it also demands theoretical dissecting as well as 
rigorous practicing. This workshop is going to cover both the approaches. </p>

<p>From the approach undertaken by BUET Photographic Society, following the leads of the workshop instructor Ashraful Awal Mishuk 
(Faculty, Pathshala South Asian Media Academy), 35 young enthusiast photographers were put to one of the most joyful and yet 
challenging task of a photographer, discovering streets. From the history of the forgotten to the eye soothing examples of the masters, 
these people went through a journey worth being attached to. After that they were challenged on the field to show their skills. They 
spread across the whole Dhaka city and quite interestingly managed to shade a unique perspective to the city we love. After the on 
field shooting sessions our participants received valuable reviews from Ashraful Awal Mishuk, Debasish Shom & Tanvir Murad Topu 
(all three of them are respected faculty members of Pathshala South Asian Media Academy). Our workshop was a grand success and 
after that all the photos taken by the participants went through a rigorous selection and curation phase. So now, here we are 
with the on campus exhibition as promised. This is an exhibition to showcase the honest and youthful output of the workshop participants.</p>


<p>This 3 day workshop is segmented in 3 parts.</p>
