            "Fahim Hossain grew up in Mymensingh, Bangladesh and now works in Edmonton, Canada. His artistic practices revolve around understanding the world through the medium of cartography, photography, and video. Through his works, he explores the concepts of personal geographies, representation and production of space and place, and the notion of homeland, geographical boundaries, and identity.",

                    "Satellite-like images are produced that portray the earth's land cover-like features, such as water bodies, mountains, lands, etc. The artist has carefully allowed this room's window to freeze during winter times, for ice and frost to build up. Once it reached the desired amount, he took a series of photos. This work invites a dialogue on the ways we map and understand the world and the future."

                    "Bangladesh and India share a land border of 4,096 kilometers. Over the last 10 years, 294 Bangladeshi citizens have been killed by the Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) â€” mostly for crossing the border illegally. In this work, the artist uses satellite images and red dots to represent the location of Bangladeshi residents killed by the BSF. Through this work, the artist attempts to invite the viewers to imagine the borderline between Bangladesh and India and think about the fundamental philosophical questions on the drawing of geographic boundaries between countries."
